# Accountant

Accountant is a ClojureScript library to make navigation in single-page
applications easy.

By default, clicking a link in a ClojureScript application that it's just a
link to a URL fragment will trigger a full page reload. This obviously defeats
the purpose of using such an elegant framework as Om, Reagent, et al.

With Accountant, links that correspond to defined Secretary routes trigger
dispatches to those routes, but don't reload the page.

## Installation

Just add the following to your `project.clj`:

```clojure
:dependencies [venantius/accountant "0.1.0"]
```

## Usage

All you have to do to get Accountant working is the following:

```clojure
(ns your-app-ns
  (:require [accountant.core :as accountant]))

(accountant/configure)
```

...and you're good to go!
